*sauna.reload: so that you can finish your Plone development today and relax in
sauna after calling it a day*

.. contents:: :local:


Introduction
=============

``sauna.reload`` partially restarts Plone and reloads your changed source
code every time you save a file.

* Edit your code
* Save
* Go to a browser and hit *Refresh* |->| your latest changes are active

It greatly simplifies your Plone development workflow and gives back the
agility of Python.

It works with any code.

``sauna.reload`` works on OSX and Linux with Plone 4.0 and 4.1. In theory
works on Windows, but no one has looked into that yet.

Installation
==============

Here are brief installation instructions.


Prerequisitements
-----------------

In order to take the advantage of ``sauna.reload``

* You know how to develop your own Plone add-ons and basics of buildout folder
  structure

* You know UNIX command line basics

* You know how to run buildout

No knowledge for warming up sauna is needed in order to use this product.

.. note:: Currently it is recommended to install sauna.reload directly from
   GitHub as it is under heavy development.


Using new buildout file for the development
-------------------------------------------

This is the recommended approach how to enable ``sauna.reload`` for your
development environment.

Use git to fetch  ``sauna.reload`` source code to your buildout environment::

  cd src
  git clone git://github.com/epeli/sauna.reload.git

Create a new buildout file ``development.cfg`` which extends your existing
``buildout.cfg`` â€“ this way you can easily keep development stuff separate
from your main buildout.cfg which you can also use on the production server.

``development.cfg``::

  [buildout]

  extends = buildout.cfg

  develop +=
      src/sauna.reload

  [instance]

  # XXX: May conflict with existing zope-conf-additional directives
  zope-conf-additional =
      %import sauna.reload

  eggs +=
      sauna.reload

.. note:: With this approach you do not need to modify the existing
   buildout.cfg.

Then build it out with this special config file::

  bin/buildout -c development.cfg

*I like to buildout buildout. I like to buildout buildout...*


OSX special notes
+++++++++++++++++

.. note:: The following applies to OSX only until Watchog 0.5.4+ is released.

For OSX you need to install trunk version of WatchDog providing `FSEvents
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSEvents>`_ based file-system monitoring support.

Use git to fetch  ``watchdog`` source code to your buildout environment::

  cd src
  git clone git://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog.git
 
Add ``watchdog`` as a developed egg into your buildout configuration just next
to ``sauna.reload``.

``development.cfg``::

  [buildout]

  develop +=
      src/watchdog
      src/sauna.reload

If you are using vim (or macvim) on OSX, you must disable vim's writebackups to
allow WatchDog to see your modifications (otherwise vim will technically create
a new file on each save and WatchDog doesn't really understand what happened).

So, Add the following to the end of your ``.vimrc``::

  set noswapfile
  set nobackup
  set nowritebackup


Updating the existing buildout.cfg
----------------------------------

Alternatively you can just hack your existing buildout.cfg to have
``sauna.reload``.

Add this package to your buildout eggs and add following
``zope-conf-additional`` line  to you instance part of buildout.cfg::

  [instance]
  recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
  ...
  zope-conf-additional = %import sauna.reload


Usage: start Plone in reload enabled manner
===========================================

To start Plone with reload functionality you need
to give special environment variable ``RELOAD_PATH``
for your instance command::

  RELOAD_PATH=src bin/instance fg

Or if you want to optimize load speed you can directly specify only some of
your development products::

  RELOAD_PATH=src/my.product:src/my.another.product bin/instance fg

.. warning:: If other products depend on your product, e.g CMFPlone
   dependencies, sauna.reload does not kick in early enough and the reload does
   not work.

When reload is active you should see something like this in your console
when Zope starts up::

  2011-08-10 13:28:59 INFO sauna.reload Starting file monitor on /Users/moo/code/x/plone4/src
  2011-08-10 13:29:02 INFO sauna.reload We saved at least 29.8229699135 seconds from boot up time
  2011-08-10 13:29:02 INFO sauna.reload Packages marked for reload are listed in here: http://127.0.0.1:8080/@@saunareload
  2011-08-10 13:29:02 INFO sauna.reload Fork loop starting on process 14607
  2011-08-10 13:29:02 INFO sauna.reload Booted up new new child in 0.104816913605 seconds. Pid 14608

... and when you save some file in ``src`` folder::

  2011-08-10 13:29:41 INFO SignalHandler Caught signal SIGINT
  2011-08-10 13:29:41 INFO Z2 Shutting down
  2011-08-10 13:29:42 INFO SignalHandler Caught signal SIGCHLD
  2011-08-10 13:29:42 INFO sauna.reload Booted up new new child in 0.123936891556 seconds. Pid 14609

CTRL+C should terminate Zope normally. There might be stil some kinks and error
messages with shutdown.

.. note:: Your reloadable eggs must be included using z3c.autoinclude
   mechanism.

Only eggs loaded through `z3c.autoinclude
<http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/247>`_.  can be reloaded. Make sure
you don't use buildout.cfg ``zcml =`` directive for your eggs or
``sauna.reload`` silently ignores changes.


Manual reload
-------------

There is also a view on Zope2 root from which it is possible to manually reload
code::

  http://127.0.0.1:8080/@@saunareload


Debugging with ``sauna.reload``
===============================

Regular ``import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`` will work just fine with
``sauna.reload``. When reload happens while in pdb, though, pdb will get
killed. To avoid losing your terminal echo, because of reload unexpectedly
killing your pdb, you may add the following to your ``~/.pdbrc``::

  import termios, sys
  term_fd = sys.stdin.fileno()
  term_echo = termios.tcgetattr(term_fd)
  term_echo[3] = term_echo[3] | termios.ECHO
  term_result = termios.tcsetattr(term_fd, termios.TCSADRAIN, term_echo)


Background
==========

``sauna.reload`` is an attempt to recreate ``plone.reload`` without the issues
it has. Like being unable to reload new grokked views or portlet code. This
project was started on Plone Sauna Sprint 2011. There for the name,
``sauna.reload``.

It can reload:

* Portlets
* Schema Interface changes
* Adapters
* Meta programming magic (e.g. Grok)
* ZCML
* Translations (changes in PO files)
* etc.

``sauna.reload`` does reloading by using a fork loop. So actually it does not
reload the code, but restarts small part of Zope2.

It does following on Zope2 startup:

1. Defers loading of your development packages by hooking into PEP 302 loader
   and changing their ``z3c.autoinclude`` target module

2. Starts a watcher thread which monitors changes in your development py-files

3. Stops loading of Zope2 in ``zope.processlifetime.IProcessStarting`` event by
   stepping into a infinite loop; Just before this, tries to load all
   non-developed dependencies of your development packages (resolved by
   ``z3c.autoinclude``)

4. It forks a new child and lets it pass the loop

5. Loads all your development packages invoking ``z3c.autoinclude``. This is
   fast!

6. And now every time when the watcher thread detects a change in development
   files it will signal the child to shutdown and the child will signal
   the parent to fork a new child when it is just about to close itself

7. Just before dying, the child saves ``Data.fs.index`` to help the new child
   to see the changes in ZODB (by loading the saved index)

8. GOTO 4

Internally ``sauna.reload`` uses
`WatchDog <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog>`_
Python component for monitoring file-system change events.

See also `Ruby guys on fork trick <http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ghLCtCwAKqQ#t=286s>`_.

Events
======

.. note:: The following concerns you only if your code needs to react specially
   to reloads (clear caches, etc.)

``sauna.reload`` emits couple of events during reloading.

**sauna.reload.events.INewChildForked**
  Emited immediately after new process is forked. No development packages have
  been yet installed.  Useful if you want to do something before your code gets
  loaded.  Note that you cannot listen this event on a package that is marked
  for reloading as it is not yet installed when this is fired.

**sauna.reload.events.INewChildIsReady**
  Emitted when all the development packages has been installed to the new
  forked child.  Useful for notifications etc.


Limitations
===========

Deferring installation of development packages to the end of Plone boot up
process means that reloading of Core Plone packages is tricky (or impossible?).
For example plone.app.form is depended by CMFPlone and CMFPlone really must be
installed before the fork loop or there would be no speed difference between
``sauna.reload`` and normal Plone restart. So we cannot defer the installation
of plone.app.form to the end of boot up process. You would have to remove the
dependency from CMFPlone for development to make it work...

Also because the product installation order is altered you may find some issues
if your product does something funky on installation or at import time.

Currently only FileStorage (ZODB) is supported.

Please report any other issues at:
https://github.com/epeli/sauna.reload/issues.


Troubleshooting
===============

Report all issues on `GitHub <https://github.com/epeli/sauna.reload>`_.


My code does not reload properly
--------------------------------

You'll see reload process going on in the terminal, but your code is still not
loaded.

You should see following warnings with zcml-paths from your products::

  2011-08-13 09:38:12 ERROR sauna.reload.child Failed to defer
  src/sauna.reload/sauna/reload/configure.zcml. IT WILL NOT BE RELOADABLE.

Make sure your code is hooked into Plone through
`z3c.autoinclude <http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/247>`_ and NOT
using explicit ``zcml = directive`` in buildout.cfg.

* Retrofit your eggs with autoinclude support if needed
* Remove zcml = lines for your eggs in buildout.cfg
* Rerun buildout (remember bin/buildout -c development.cfg)
* Restart Plone with sauna.reload enabled


sauna.reload is not active - nothing printed on console
-------------------------------------------------------

Check that your buildout.cfg includes
``zope-conf-additionalzope-conf-additional`` line.

If using separate ``development.cfg`` make sure you run your buildout using
it::

  bin/buildout -c development.cfg

Thanks to all happy hackers on Sauna Sprint 2011!

300 kg of beer was consumed to create this package (at least). Also several
kilos of firewood, one axe, one chainsaw and one boat.

We still need testers and contributors. You are very welcome!
